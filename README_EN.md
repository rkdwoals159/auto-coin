## üìã Program Overview

**Aden** is an automated arbitrage trading system that monitors price differences between **Orderly** and **Gate.io** exchanges in real-time and executes arbitrage trades automatically.

### üéØ Key Features

- **Automated Arbitrage Trading**: Automatically enters/exits positions when threshold is exceeded
- **Smart Filtering**: Detects safe trading opportunities based on volume and price difference criteria
- **Position Management**: Automatic tracking of entry/exit prices and profit calculation
- **Telegram Notifications**: Real-time trading alerts and profit information

### üí∞ Trading Method

- **Orderly**: USDC futures trading
- **Gate.io**: USDT futures trading
- **Arbitrage**: Buy on one exchange, sell on the other
- **Market Orders**: Uses market orders for quick execution

### üí∏ Fee Information

- **Orderly Market Fee**: 0.009%
- **Gate.io Market Fee**: 0.04% (up to 80% rebate with referral)

### üéØ Arbitrage Trading Principle

This program **monitors price differences between two exchanges in real-time** and **enters opposite positions on the coin with the highest price difference** to profit from the arbitrage opportunity.

#### üìä Basic Arbitrage Principle

**Arbitrage Trading** is a trading method that profits from price differences of the same asset traded at different prices in different markets.

**Example:**

- **BTC Price on Orderly**: $42,000
- **BTC Price on Gate.io**: $41,800
- **Price Difference**: $200 (0.48% difference)

#### üîÑ Trading Execution Process

**Step 1: Real-time Monitoring**

- Track price differences of all coins every 500ms
- Filter by trading volume (500k USDT minimum) for stability
- Check price difference threshold (0.5% minimum)

**Step 2: Optimal Opportunity Detection**

- Automatically select coin with highest price difference
- Comprehensive analysis of volume, liquidity, and price stability
- Calculate risk vs. reward ratio

**Step 3: Opposite Position Entry**

- **Orderly Price > Gate.io Price**: Buy on Orderly + Sell on Gate.io
- **Gate.io Price > Orderly Price**: Buy on Gate.io + Sell on Orderly
- Parallel order processing for fast execution

**Step 4: Profit Realization**

- Automatic position closure when price difference decreases
- Automatic closure when target profit is reached (default: 0.4%)
- Real-time profit calculation and Telegram notifications

#### üí∞ Profit Structure

**Profit = (High Price - Low Price) - (Fees + Slippage)**

**Example Calculation:**

- Trading 1 BTC
- Price difference: $200
- Orderly fee: $42,000 √ó 0.009% = $3.78
- Gate.io fee: $41,800 √ó 0.04% = $16.72
- **Net Profit**: $200 - $3.78 - $16.72 = **$179.50**

#### ‚ö° Advantages of Automation

- **24/7 Monitoring**: Captures opportunities humans might miss
- **Fast Execution**: Trade execution within 500ms to secure opportunities
- **Emotion-free**: Algorithm-based objective decisions
- **Risk Management**: Automatic stop-loss and profit taking

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Parameters

You can adjust the following values in `main.ts`:

```typescript
const ORDERBOOK_MAX_LEVEL = 3; // Maximum orderbook level
const MIN_24_AMOUNT = 500000; // 24-hour trading amount condition
const POSITON_PERCENT = 1; // Position percentage (% of current seed)
const PAUSE_THRESHOLD = 0.4; // Price difference threshold (%)
const TARGET_PROFIT_PERCENT = 0.4; // Target profit rate (%)
const DURATION_HOURS = 500; // Monitoring duration (hours)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Market Order Warnings

**Currently, this program uses market orders for position entry/exit.**

- **Low-volume coins** may not achieve desired price difference rates
- **Market order characteristics** may cause slippage (price sliding)
- **Select high-volume coins** or increase `MIN_24_AMOUNT` value to strengthen volume criteria

### üîß Volume Criteria Adjustment Method

To prevent issues with low-volume coins, adjust the following value in `main.ts`:

```typescript
// Increase volume criteria to trade only liquid coins
const MIN_24_AMOUNT = 1000000; // 1M USDT minimum (default: 500k)
```

### üí° Default Settings Recommendations

**For safe and stable trading, the following settings are recommended:**

```typescript
const MIN_24_AMOUNT = 500000; // 500k USDT minimum (volume criteria)
const PAUSE_THRESHOLD = 0.5; // 0.5% minimum (price difference threshold)
```

**Recommended reasons:**

- **500k USDT minimum volume**: Minimizes slippage and ensures stable trading
- **0.5% minimum price difference**: Ensures sufficient profit margin considering fees
- **Both conditions must be met** to minimize risk

### üí∞ Fee Optimization Tips

**Since this program generates profit based on price differences between two exchanges, fee optimization is very important.**

#### Gate.io Referral System Utilization

- **Gate.io referral link** registration provides **fee discount** benefits
- **Referral code** usage can **save up to 40% on trading fees**
- **Referral link**: [Gate.io Official Referral Program](https://www.gate.io/referral)

#### Fee Optimization Effects

- **Default fee**: 0.06% (Maker) / 0.06% (Taker)
- **After referral discount**: 0.036% (Maker) / 0.036% (Taker)
- **Fee savings in arbitrage trading** significantly impact cumulative profit rates

### ‚ö†Ô∏è QA and Error Related Warnings

**Accurate QA for position entry/exit has not been completed yet.**

#### üö® Possible Error Situations

- **Unexpected errors** may occur during position entry/exit
- **Market order characteristics** may result in different execution prices than expected

#### üìä Specific Error Examples

```
Expected Trade:
- Aden.io: BTC Long entry (expected: $42,000)
- Gate.io: BTC Short entry (expected: $41,800)

Actual Execution:
- Aden.io: BTC Long entry (actual: $42,200) ‚Üê Slippage occurred
- Gate.io: BTC Short entry (actual: $41,600) ‚Üê Slippage occurred

Result: Aden.io execution price ($42,200) > Gate.io execution price ($41,600)
‚Üí Arbitrage logic error may occur
```

#### üõ°Ô∏è Error Prevention Methods

1. **Set volume criteria high enough** (recommended: 1M USDT minimum)
2. **Set price difference threshold high enough** (recommended: 0.8% minimum)
3. **Manually verify market conditions before trading**
4. **Test with small amounts and gradually expand**

**Volume criteria settings:**

- **Conservative trading**: `MIN_24_AMOUNT = 1000000` (1M USDT)
- **Aggressive trading**: `MIN_24_AMOUNT = 500000` (500k USDT)
- **Testing**: `MIN_24_AMOUNT = 300000` (300k USDT)
